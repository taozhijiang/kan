### Kan

This is a simple [Raft consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) implementation and used for KV store purpose.   

The development task has not completed yet, this implementation currently supports RequestVote, AppendEntries, InstallSnapshots RPCs, it does not support dynamic membership configure update, but it can basically run now.   

It is developed based on [tzrpc](https://github.com/taozhijiang/tzrpc), which support async client invoking now, and this feature can greately simplify the whole system architecture design. The consensus algorithm core code is almost the same as its authorâ€™s original implementation, so we can assume our implementation is right arbitrarily. Perhaps I will try to PASS the [jepsen test](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) in the future.  
LevelDB is used for Raft log entries and meta data duration, and is also used for StateMachine storage, and this means Kan aims for stable KV storage usage. We abstracted client request as RPC interface, and it can atomically forward the request to the desired peer when the node connected is not Leader.   

```bash
# prepare the log and storage directory
~ mkdir log storage

# bootstrap, initialize the whole cluster firstly
~ bin/kan_service_10801 -c ../kan_example_10801_bootstrap.conf

# start the cluster to work
~ bin/kan_service_10801 -c ../kan_example_10801.conf -d
~ bin/kan_service_10802 -c ../kan_example_10802.conf -d
~ bin/kan_service_10803 -c ../kan_example_10803.conf -d
```

And you can build the tools directory, which provides clientOps, controlOps and clientPerf functions.
